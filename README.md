Zomato Restaurant Analysis
Objective
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to uncover insights into restaurant operations, customer preferences, and dining trends. The goal is to identify actionable patterns in restaurant ratings, customer votes, pricing, and other key factors to support strategic business decisions for restaurant growth and optimization.

Observations
1. Target Audience
Mature and Adult audiences make up the majority of content, with most restaurants catering to these groups.
Around 20% of the content targets children under 13 years of age, showing that restaurants also serve children, with a focus on family-friendly experiences.
2. Popular Restaurant Types
Quick Bites and Casual Dining have the most outlets.
Restaurants offering alcohol generally have higher ratings, votes, and more photo uploads.
3. City-Wise Insights
Bangalore has the most number of restaurants in the dataset.
Gurgaon has the highest-rated restaurants with an average rating of 3.83.
Hyderabad sees the most critics (highest number of votes).
Mumbai and New Delhi have the highest number of photo uploads per outlet.
4. Cuisine Preferences
North Indian cuisine is the most popular, followed by Chinese.
International cuisines tend to have higher ratings than local cuisines.
Gastro pubs, romantic dining, and craft beer features are rated highly by customers.
5. Pricing and Rating Patterns
Most restaurants have ratings between 3 and 4.
The majority of restaurants are budget-friendly, with an average cost for two ranging from ₹250 to ₹800.
As the average cost for two increases, so does the likelihood of receiving higher ratings.
Recommendations
1. Expand Genre Diversity
Most countries, other than the US, focus on a limited number of genres. There’s an opportunity to tailor content to local tastes, such as offering Indian Mythological content that could attract global attention similar to the popularity of Japanese Anime.
2. Tailor Content to Country Demographics
Netflix should produce more country-specific content based on the demographic makeup of each country. For example:
India: Most content falls within TV-MA, TV-14, and TV-PG ratings, suggesting that the target audience is primarily teenagers and adults. There is a need for more content targeting children under 14 and older adults over 35.

Conclusion
The analysis reveals valuable insights into restaurant operations and customer preferences. By focusing on expanding genre offerings, tailoring content for specific regional audiences, and improving pricing strategies, restaurants can enhance customer satisfaction, increase ratings, and attract more business. Furthermore, focusing on shorter content and expanding offerings based on regional preferences could contribute to Netflix’s growth and popularity across diverse markets
